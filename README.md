# modjson
Modify JSON or search for an object using a key.

## Current status
This is work in progress but the idea is that we should be able to search for an object in the JSON tree and add/remove an object based on the key provide.

### Features
- Ability to parse JSON object from a provided data (string) and pretty print it.
- Search for values based on the key provided and return as string.
